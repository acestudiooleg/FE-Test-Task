Hi!

This test task is designed to easily and quickly test your level of Javascript knowledge.

When you run the server you will see a page in your browser, on the left side of which will be a gallery with the ability to search for photos by tags. On the right side of the screen will be a description of the task with the result of auto-tests.

Your task is to satisfy the autotests by following the instructions in the tasks, remembering that the result on the left side of the screen must also work.

Task #3 will use the API of a third-party service. And if you don't get any pictures, try to register and get your own key ;-).

Good luck!

P.S. Do not change the tests!
